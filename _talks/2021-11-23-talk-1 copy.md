This year, to facilitate cross-faculty student connection and increase engagement, UTMIST (University of Toronto Machine Intelligence Student Team) will be collaborating with ISSC and Prof. Caetano to deliver a monthly, virtual speaker series from May to August. The details and expectations are listed below.

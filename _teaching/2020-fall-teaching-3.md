Machine learning (ML) is a set of techniques that allow computers to learn from data and experience rather than requiring humans to specify the desired behaviour by hand. ML has become increasingly central both in AI as an academic field and industry. This course provides a broad introduction to some of the most commonly used ML algorithms. It also introduces vital algorithmic principles that will serve as a foundation for more advanced courses, such as CSC412/2506 (Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning) and CSC413/2516 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning).

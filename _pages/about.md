I am a senior Ph.D. student from RA^2D: Robotics-assisted Accelerated Discovery lab at the Acceleration Consortium. I am supervised by Prof Al√°n Asupuru-Guizk, Prof Animesh Grag and Prof Florian Shkurti. RA^2D lab is focused on building universal robot for lab automation and accelerating science discoveries. My research focus is computer vision and robotics control related to lab automation. In particular, I am interested in perception and vision guided robot planning and control for transparent objects. I has publications in topics of 2D perception, depth completion, multiview 3D perception and robot manipulations for transparent objects in lab settings.
